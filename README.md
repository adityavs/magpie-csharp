Magpie is my slightly-more-than-hobby programming language. It's been through a
few forms. The current one is [here](https://github.com/munificent/magpie).
This is the first version of it, when it was statically-typed and written in
C#.

No active development is going on here. It's preserved for
historical/entertainment purposes.
