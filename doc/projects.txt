// magproj
a project file describes where to find sources and other related
projects. in this way, everything related to finding files and the
filesystem is encapsulated in projects, and sources files only deal
with namespaces and code.

projects can contain regular block and line comments. there are also
a couple of built-in commands


reference <project>
// references another project from this one. <project> is the name
// and possibly relative path to another project file, without the
// extension. magpie will search through the search directories
// looking for a matching project. before searching the global search
// paths, it will look for a matching project relative to this one.
// ex: reference Core/Collections

include <pattern>
// includes the magpie scripts that match the given pattern. file
// extension should not be used. directory names and wildcards can be
// used. searches relative to the project file's location.
// ex: include *

exclude <pattern>
// excludes matching scripts from the project. include and exclude
// commands are processed in order, and the set of matching scripts
// that are left after all commands are processed is what is loaded.

search <path>
// adds the given path to the set of search paths to use when looking
// for projects

nosearch <path>
// removes the last instance of the given search path from the search
// paths
